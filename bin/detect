# This script serves as the
# [**Python Buildpack**](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python)
# detector.
#
# A [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between a Python application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1

# Setup Path variables, for later use in the Buildpack.
BIN_DIR=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"; pwd) # absolute path

# Import the utils script, which contains helper functions used throughout the buildpack.
# shellcheck source=bin/utils
source "$BIN_DIR/utils"

# Exit early if app is clearly not Python.
PACKAGING_TOOL="$(python_determine_packaging_tool "$BUILD_DIR")"
echo Detected packaging tool $PACKAGING_TOOL
if $PACKAGING_TOOL -eq "INDETERMINATE"; then
