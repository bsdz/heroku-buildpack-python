#
# A [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between a Python application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1

# Import the utils script, which contains helper functions used throughout the buildpack.
# shellcheck source=bin/utils
source "$BIN_DIR/utils"

# Exit early if app is clearly not Python.
